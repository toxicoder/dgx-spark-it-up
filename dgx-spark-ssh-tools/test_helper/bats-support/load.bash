# This is a minimal implementation for bats-support that provides basic functionality
# For a real project, you would typically install bats-support via package manager
# But for our purposes, we'll create a minimal version that works with the existing tests

# Provide the basic functions that are typically available in bats-support
# Since we're using BATS 1.8.2, we'll create simplified versions that match what's expected

# Simple assert implementation - we'll use basic BATS functionality instead
